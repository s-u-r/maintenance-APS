Overview 

Scania, a heavy haulage truck manufacturer, wants to reduce costs by minimizing the failure rate of air pressure systems in the field. 

The goal is predicting a failure before it occurs, and performing cost effective preventative maintenance, rather than expensive rescue and repair in the field.  



Goals 

Predict an imminent failure of the Air Pressure System from sensor data using Machine Learning. 

Reduce costs by both selective, preventative maintenance to avoid a failure in the field, and avoiding unnecessary loss of man hours.
